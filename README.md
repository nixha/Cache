# README "Cache"

## Plot
Playing around with basic thoughts about caching...

...I created the simple interface 
`Cache` and some simple implementations providing the real basic `SimpleCache` 
and the more flexible `ExtensibleCache`. This solution neither claims best
performance nor optimal strategies. It just provides an experimental simple 
base for caching. 


## History

### 1.0.0 Initial commit
